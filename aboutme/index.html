    <h2>Izzie</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Let me introduce myself.</p>
    <p>My name is Izzie Vazquez, I recently turned 20 years old, I'm from New Jersey, and I'm a software engineering major here at Brigham Young University-Idaho, with an emphasis in software design. I am also an illustration minor, though I am considering swapping over to web development! This is my fifth semester on-campus at BYU-I, though I took a few concurrent emrollment courses here during high school.</p>
    <p>My hobbies outside of school include digital art, gaming, writing, and playing tabletop roleplay games like Dungeons & Dragons! I am additionally a very crafty person, and love all things beadwork, especially bracelets!</p>
    <p>I'm excited to get to know my classmates this semester! Thanks for taking the time to read through my webpage!<span class="emoji">&#x1F60A;</span></p>
